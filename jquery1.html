   <p id="p1"> Lorem ipsum, in graphical and textual context, refers to filler text that is placed in a document or visual presentation.
     Lorem ipsum is derived from the Latin "dolorem ipsum" roughly translated as "pain itself."<span> Lorem ipsum presents the sample 
     font and orientation of writing on Web pages and other software </span>applications where content is not the main concern of the developer.<p>

<p id="p2">
        Lorem ipsum is the nonsense filler text that typically demonstrates the font and style of a text in a document 
        or visual demonstration. Originally from Latin, lorem ipsum has no intelligible meaning, but is simply a display of letters 
        and characteristics to be viewed as a sample with given graphical elements in a file. Lipsum (portmanteau of lorem and ipsum) 
        generators are commonly used to form generic text in a file.<span> The “gibberish” is adequately like normal text to demonstrate a font, 
        but does not distract the reader with its content. </span> has been used as placeholder text since the 16th century.
